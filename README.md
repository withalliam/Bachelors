## What does this project do?
 This project developed the Wesane game through open source and made it a vesrion suitable for Handong Global University so that studensts can enjoy it. Using Raspberrry pi and html, I created a web that explain the game briefly, and start the game.
<br><br> Through this README.md file, I will briefly explain how to make this game, and you will be able to make a version that you wnat to make through the link reference.
 
## The things I did on this project
1. First of all, I edited the image files in a resolution that fits the game.
2. I downloaded the Wesane game code file from GitHub. The GitHub link is in the refernce below.
3. I registered the image for resolution and downloaded the compressed file. A link to compress the file is in the rference below too.
4. I created the web using Raspberry pi and html, then made my own version using a free html template.

## How do I get started?
1. When you start the game, you can see 오석관 with the beautiful sunset. (I took this picture 😀)
2. If you press or drag the screen away, the ball drops to that position.
3. Each time you press, the ball drops randomly from freshman duck to returning duck.
4. Ducks in the same grade and semester combine to become a duck in the next grade and semester.
5. The higher the grade and semester duck, the higher the score.
6. The game ends when ducks pile up at a certain height or more.
7. You can access to the game link above.
8. Enjoy the game with friends comparing the scores.

## How can I make my own version?
간단하게 진행 단계 별로 설명만 해놓고, 그 단계에 대한 자세한 설명들은 링크로 참조해놓겠다.
1. 본인이 사용하고 싶은 이미지 파일을 해상도에 맞게 편집해야 한다. (PNG로 해야한다)
2. 깃허브에서 수박게임 코드파일을 다운로드 한다.
3. 이미지를 등록하여 압축 파일을 다운로드 받는다.
4. Node js 프로그램을 설치한다.
5. github 계정을 통해 vercel에 회원가입한다.
6. cmd 명령프롬포트를 이용하여 vercel app을 배포시키면 된다.


## Why is this project useful?
it was targeted at students at Handong University. When I ran a simple test on students, people were interested and funny. People were having a hard time at the end of the semester, but I thought it was meaningful to provide a service that allowed people to laugh and rest for a while while using this service.
오픈소스를 통해 게임이 배포되어 있지만, 중국어로 되어있어 사람들이 쉽게 접하기 힘들고
처음 시작할 때 어떻게 해야하는지가 막막해 이 프로젝트를 통해쉽게 시작할 수 있다.
만약 자기가 자신만의 버전으로 만들고 싶다면, 위의 설명과 아래의 링크들을 통해 개발하여 즐길 수 있다.


## Where can I get more help, if i need it?
풀 리퀘 - 깃허브로
질문 - 이메일로
