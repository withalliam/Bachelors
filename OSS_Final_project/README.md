## What does this project do?
 This project developed the Wesane game through open source and made it a vesrion suitable for Handong Global University so that studensts can enjoy it. Using Raspberrry pi and html, I created a web that explain the game briefly, and start the game.
<br><br> Through this README.md file, I will briefly explain how to make this game, and you will be able to make a version that you wnat to make through the link reference.

## The things I did on this project
1. First of all, I edited the image files in a resolution that fits the game.
<br><br> ![imagefile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79792577/121700419-d9da3580-cb0a-11eb-8b15-c3514f008042.PNG)
2. I downloaded the Wesane game code file from GitHub.

3. I registered the image for resolution on website and downloaded the compressed file.
4. I installed Node.js program, and signed up for Vercel via GitHub account.
5. By using the cmd command prompt, I obtained my game link.
6. I created the web using Raspberry pi and html, then made my own version using a free html template.

## How do I get started?
1. When you start the game, you can see Ïò§ÏÑùÍ¥Ä with the beautiful sunset. (I took this picture üòÄ)
2. If you press or drag the screen away, the ball drops to that position.
3. Each time you press, the ball drops randomly from freshman duck to returning duck.
4. Ducks in the same grade and semester combine to become a duck in the next grade and semester.
5. The higher the grade and semester duck, the higher the score.
6. The game ends when ducks pile up at a certain height or more.
7. You can access to the game link above and here. https://daxigua-master-seokjunkim.vercel.app/
8. Enjoy the game with friends comparing the scores.

## How can I make my own version?
I will explain briefly by step, and refer to the link for detailed descriptions of the steps.
1. You should edit the image file you want to use to fit the resolution. (by PNG)
2. Download the Wesane game code file from GitHub. The GitHub link is in the refernce below.
3. Register the image for resolution and download the compressed file. A link to compress the file is in the rference below too. 
4. Install Node.js
5. Sign up for Vercel via GitHub account.
6. You can use the cmd command prompt to deploy the Vercel app.
7. Then you can obtain a game link.

## Why is this project useful?
 First of all, it is targeted at students at Handong Global University. I shared a prototype of the game with the people around me, they enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays, when resting or enjoying a short time, most students watch YouTube. Instead of watching YouTube, this game can be a fresh material to enjoy for a short time. In the game, **the ducks are very cute** and I made semester ducks with topics that students will sympathize with and enjoy. The ducks are reminiscent of us. 
<br><br>
 Moreover, the game is distributed through open source in GitHub, but it is difficult for Koreans to access it easily because it is in Chinese. Most people are at a loss for what to do when they start. On the other hand, it is easily accessible through this project. It took me a lot of time to find various sites when I made this game, but you can save time by the reference in this project. If you want to make your own version, you can develop and enjoy through the explanation above and the links below.
